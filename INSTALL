To use Revelation you need to have pygtk 2.0.0, gnome-python 2.0.0
and pycrypto 1.9 installed.

Installation is done using a standard Python setup.py file. Quick
instructions are (as root):

python setup.py build
python setup.py install


You may need to restart gconfd-2 after installing for the first time,
as gconf doesn't sense changes to the central database. Run
'gconftool-2 --shutdown' as your normal user, or send it a SIGHUP.

If you are reinstalling or upgrading Revelation you may need to use
the --force argument to install, otherwise the old files will not be
replaced.
